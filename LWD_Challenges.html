      <h1 class="main-heading">LWD : The Challenges</h1>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="text">LWD is a little acronym I made which stands for 'Learning Web Development' or 'Learn Web
        Development' based upon how its used. With that clear now, we will now talk in this article what are the common
        challenges one face, or atleast I faced and still do, when I decided to LWD. This article is strictly written
        with the perspective of LWD on a path of self learning.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Why and How LWD happened(for me)?[OPTIONAL: CAN SKIP]</h2>
      <p class="text">I started just recently in March 2019 when I decided that I am so done with my testing job(a
        manual testing job) and I saw no growth happening personally and career wise. It was a time of depression and
        anxiety for me. One day I sat with my partner(wife) and we played a game. We wrote down some career options on
        small chits of paper and fold and mixed them. All career options were related to my hobbies and interests and
        even if I had very little interest in any of them, we wrote it down. Aim was to pick a chit randomly. The first
        career option to appear thrice would be given a go. Now, I would agree that sounds a bit cheesy but all during
        this 'game of career' I was really rooting for web development as out of all it had my most interest. And it
        happened, first job option that was picked thrice was 'Web Development'. So, that's that.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Resource Juggling</h2>
      <p class="text">I saw youtube videos and tried to read articles on web about basics of web development. I was
        juggling with youtube videos, reading blogs, listening podcasts and trying to identify the good resource. I even
        got to udemy and tried to look for best starting course. I was really struggling to identify what to learn and
        from where. Should I do HTML, CSS or JS? Because one thing led to another and to understand a tutorial I had to
        constantly search for what was being referred to. It was, believe me, a lot tougher than I thought. I really had
        no starting point and I was completely lost. I even thought of going back to my old career but didn't somehow.
        Days were passing by and I was getting depressed day by day. But I wasn't doing one thing that should've been
        done straightaway.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Eye Opener</h2>
      <p class="text">As suggested in many articles/blog posts/tutorials, a web dev needs to have social accounts(on
        LinkedIn, Twitter atleast). Scrolling through my twitter feed one day, I saw a mention about freeCodeCamp and
        how it is supporting beginners just like me, at no cost at all. I made an account on it and decided to give it a
        go. I don't know about others but this is what I was looking for. Each lesson is atmost 5 minute read and few
        lines of code. Yes, I was writing some code. It gave me a huge boost. The curriculum is designed to take you one
        step at a time. Unlike others, or atleast what I have seen. This is in no way an endorsement of freeCodeCamp. It
        worked for me, something else might work for you.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text">If I summarize, the biggest challenges were, 1. Deciding what you want to do. 2. How to start
        doing it. 3. Patience. I am still the beginner, but almost 10 months now, I am a lot more confident and have
        made many simple web apps. Patience is really the key here and I can't stress enough on it. So if you're just
        starting out just like me, have patience. Things will start to fall into place one day. That's my story so far
        and in this series of blogs, I will continue to share more on struggles and challenges but mostly on javascript
        and other web related stuff. You can subscribe if you feel like to get notified. I wish you best in your
        journey.</p>
