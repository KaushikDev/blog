          <h1 class="main-heading">The Challenges</h1>
    
          <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
          <p class="text">LWD is a little acronym I made which stands for 'Learning Web Development' or 'Learn Web
            Development' based upon how its used. With that clear now, we will now talk in this article what are the common
            challenges one face, or atleast I faced and still do, when I decided to LWD. This article is strictly written
            with the perspective of LWD on a path of self learning.</p>
    
            
          <h2 class="sub-heading">Resource Juggling</h2>
          <p class="text">I saw youtube videos and tried to read articles on web about basics of web development. I was
            juggling with youtube videos, reading blogs, listening podcasts and trying to identify the good resource. I even
            got to udemy and tried to look for best starting course. I was really struggling to identify what to learn and
            from where. Should I do HTML, CSS or JS? Because one thing led to another and to understand a tutorial I had to
            constantly search for what was being referred to. It was, believe me, a lot tougher than I thought. I really had
            no starting point and I was completely lost. I even thought of going back to my old career but didn't somehow.
            Days were passing by and I was getting depressed day by day. But I wasn't doing one thing that should've been
            done straightaway.</p>
    
          <h2 class="sub-heading">Eye Opener</h2>
          <p class="text">As suggested in many articles/blog posts/tutorials, a web dev needs to have social accounts(on
            LinkedIn, Twitter atleast). Scrolling through my twitter feed one day, I saw a mention about freeCodeCamp and
            how it is supporting beginners just like me, at no cost at all. I made an account on it and decided to give it a
            go. I don't know about others but this is what I was looking for. Each lesson is atmost 5 minute read and few
            lines of code. Yes, I was writing some code. It gave me a huge boost. The curriculum is designed to take you one
            step at a time. Unlike others, or atleast what I have seen. This is in no way an endorsement of freeCodeCamp. It
            worked for me, something else might work for you.</p>
    
          <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="text">If I summarize, the biggest challenges were, 1. Deciding what you want to do. 2. How to start
            doing it. 3. Patience. I am still the beginner, but almost 10 months now, I am a lot more confident and have
            made many simple web apps. Patience is really the key here and I can't stress enough on it. So if you're just
            starting out just like me, have patience. Things will start to fall into place one day. That's my story so far
            and in this series of blogs, I will continue to share more on struggles and challenges but mostly on javascript
            and other web related stuff. You can subscribe if you feel like to get notified. I wish you best in your
            journey.</p>
